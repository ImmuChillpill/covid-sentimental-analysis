The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on many people, creating severe anxiety, fear, and complicated feelings or emotions. After the initiation of vaccinations against coronavirus, people’s 
feelings havebecome more diverse and complex. Our aim is to understand and unraveltheir sentiments in this research using machine learning techniques. Social media is currently the best way to express
feelings and emotions, and with the help of Twitter, one can have a better idea of what is trendingand going on in people’s minds. Our motivation for this research was tounderstand the diverse sentiments
of people regarding the vaccinationprocess. In this research, the timeline of the collected tweets was fromDecember 21 to July 21. The tweets contained information about the mostcommon vaccines
available recently from across the world. The sentiments of people regarding vaccines of all sorts were assessed using the machine learning algorithms, Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner (VADER).
Initializing the polarities of the obtained sentiments into three groups (positive, negative, and neutral) helped us visualize the overall scenario; our findings included 33.96% positive,
17.55% negative, and 48.49% neutral responses. In addition, we included our analysis of the timeline of the tweets in this research, as sentiments fluctuated over time.
A recurrent machine learning oriented architecture, including logisitic regression and bidirectional LSTM (Bi- LSTM), was used to assess the performance of the predictive models, with LSTM 
achieving an accuracy of 90.59% and Bi-LSTM achieving 90.83%. Other performance metrics such as precision,, F1-score, and a confusion matrix were also used to validate our models and findings more
effectively. This study improvesunderstanding of the public’s opinion onCOVID-19 vaccines and supports the aim of eradicating coronavirus from the world
